                I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Utah, studying Computing with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.
                <br><br>
                I recently completed degrees in Computer Science and Physics at the University of Utah (B.S. in Computer Science, B.S. in Physics, May 2025). 
                <br><br>
                In computing, my interests are primarily in artificial intelligence and machine learning. For physics,
                I enjoy learning about astrophysics; specifically, I am interested in black holes. 
                <br><br>
                Overall, I enjoy solving difficult problems and learning new things.
                <br><br>
                Outside of academics, I enjoy climbing, skiing, biking, and coffee!

                        My research focuses on the detection of stellar mass black holes (black holes with a mass similar to our Sun) in a globular cluster named Omega Centauri.
                        To find these black holes, I use a method of detection known as microlensing. Microlensing occurs when a massive object passes in front of a distant light source, 
                        bending the light from the source and causing it to appear brighter for a short period of time. My work uses archival data from the Hubble Space
                        Telescope to identify these microlensing events. By studying the light curves of stars within Omega Centauri, I can infer the presence of black holes in the cluster.
