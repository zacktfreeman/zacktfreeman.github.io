                                    My research involves the detection of stellar mass black holes (black holes with a mass similar to our Sun) in a globular cluster named Omega Centauri. 
                                    To search for these black holes, I use a method of detection known as microlensing. What does all of this mean though?

                                    First, let's define what a globular cluster is. Broadly, a globular cluster is a group of stars that are all born around the same time. Omega Centauri is a globular cluster that is located within our galaxy, the Milky Way.
                                    Omega Centauri is special for this research project for a couple reasons: <br><br> 1) it is the most massive globular cluster in our galaxy, and <br>2) it has been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope hundreds of times over
                                    the last ~20 years! <br><br>
                                    <br>
                                </p>
                                <h1><u>Black Holes</u></h1>
                                <p>
                                    <br>
                                    Black holes are a result of stellar evolution. Stars, like humans, go through different phases throughout their life. For massive stars (stars roughly 18x more massive than our Sun), they end their life by forming black holes.
                                    Since Omega Centauri is so massive (<b>point #1!</b>), which means there are lots of stars, we expect there to be thousands of stellar mass black holes in the core.

                                        Microlensing is a subset of an event known as gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing is when there is an object so massive, that it will bend light that passes by it; this object is referred to as a 'lens'. From 
                                        an observer's point of view, the lens will cause an increase in brightness of a background source (such as a star) if the lensing event is small (microlensing), or it could cause 
                                        <a href = "https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-delivers-deepest-infrared-image-of-universe-yet">multiple images</a> of a background source if the lensing event is large. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <br>
                                        For the first scenario (the scenario I care about for this research), the lens can be as small as our Sun! In this case, as I mentioned,
                                        we usually will only see an increase in brightness of the source object.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <br>
                                        So why does microlensing help me in my search? As I mentioned earlier, the Hubble Space Telescope has observed Omega Centauri hundreds of times in the last ~20 years (<b>point #2!</b>). Within this data, 
                                        I am searching for a microlensing event; that is, I am searching for an increase in brightness of a star, which could be caused by a black hole.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                <h1><u>Summary</u></h1>

                                        <br>
                                        To reiterate, I am searching for a microlensing event caused by a black hole in the largest globular cluster in the Galaxy, Omega Centauri, using Hubble Space Telescope observations from the past ~20 years.
